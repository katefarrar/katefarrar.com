          p I'm an inclusive design leader with over 15 years of industry experience. I am passionate about leading design on cross functional teams and creating a sense of belonging for people at work. Iâ€™m committed to helping designers be effective leaders on cross-functional teams, empathize with their users through research and testing, and find meaning in their work.

          p I live in Colorado with my wife, Abby. We have two dogs, Norah and Rosie, and one cat, Henry.
