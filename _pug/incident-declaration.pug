      h2 The Problems

      h3 User Experience
      p One of the main value points of the product FireHydrant product is the ability to declare an incident in seconds. At this time a majority of our users relied on our Slack app, but the ones that used the FireHydrant web UI had a feature limited experience.

      h3 Business
      p Large orgs were hesitant to adopt widely adopt FireHydrant because of the gap in user experience between Slack and the web UI.Orgs that didn't use Slack were not confident in choosing FireHydrant as their Incident Management solution because of the shortcomings of the web UI particularly in regards to Incident Declaration.

      h2 Research

      p Beginning with on user interviews with customers and conversations with our Custom Success team, I created user personas to identify the key pain points that our users were experiencing. These also provided us with clear goals to validate our solutions against as we began to build.
