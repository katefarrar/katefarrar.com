      h2 The Problem

      ul
        li Legacy alerting tools are misaligned with modern software practices
        li Extremely expensive and have no material innovation for years
        li Existing tools do nothing to help an on-call engineer triage an incident
        li No handoff into an integrated Incident Management tool
        li Lack of policy enforcement for teams, schedules, and notifications
