Early on, the majority of FireHydarnt's customers relied on our Slack app, but the ones that used the FireHydrant web UI had a feature limited experience. Additionally, if Slack experienced a disruption in service that meant teams needed a reliable web UI experience for incident declaration.</p><h3>Business</h3><p>As FireHydarnt's product offerings expanded, our team begin to observe that Enterprise companies were less likely to use Slack as their internal chat tool. This meant that they had to rely solely on the web UI for incident declaration. The poor user experience and lack of feature parity with Slack meant that improving the web UI was a top priority for the product.</p></section><section><h2>Audit of current web experience</h2><img src="/assets/images/work/id-2.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Current incident declaration form experience on the web</small><ul class="m-lg"><li>Unclear path for users.</li><li>Required v. not required sections.</li><li>Help text is inconsistent and confusing.</li><li>Form is long and not conducive for taking quick action.</li></ul></section><section><h2>Challenges</h2><ul> <li>Improve experience without removing features or complexity</li><li>Feature parity with current Slack experience</li><li>Ability to choose an incident type</li><li>Optimize user flow, IA, &amp; layout</li><li>Create a resolved incident</li><li>Create reusable patterns for all forms that will be used across the product </li></ul></section><section><h2>Research</h2><p>Beginning with user interviews with customers and conversations with our Custom Success team, I created user personas to identify the key pain points that our users were experiencing. These also provided us with clear goals to validate our solutions against as we began to build. </p><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-3.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>User personas based on role</small><h3 class="m-lg">Gamedays</h3><p>I participated in "Gamedays" alongside our engineering team which were simulated incidents walking through the entire incident declaration process. This allowed me to gain empathy for users and observe my teammates going through the incident declaration process.</p></section><section><h2>Information Architecture</h2><p>In order to identify the best way to display information in the form, I extracted out the different content blocks and identified their hierarchy.</p><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-1.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Form content blocks</small></section><section><h2>Early Concepts + Prototypes</h2><p>For early concepts, I made the decision to focus on lo-fidelity mock ups in order to center the user flow and journey. This allowed us to not be distracted by UI or visual elements and to move quickly with layouts and prototypes.</p><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-8.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>First iteration of form content and wireframes</small><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-7.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Second iteration form with user flow diagram</small></section><section><h2>Final Direction</h2><p>After three rounds of iterations with the team, we settled on an experience that relied on modular content blocks. This solution allowed us to keep cognitive load low for the user, while also giving them the option to add additional complexity if they had that information.</p><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-5.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Modular form content</small><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-6.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Final user flow</small><p>We also planned to redesign from of the UI and form components with this effort, but we wanted to first validate this concept before we moved on any further. We put together a very, rough lo-fi clickable prototype and did internal testing with users from all different parts of the company. The overall feedback was extremely positive.</p><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-9.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Lo-fidelity clickable prototype for internal testing</small></section><section><h2>User Testing</h2><p>The next step was to translate the design into high fidelity prototypes with an improved UI that we could test with customers. Alongside our Head of Product, I conducted four user interview sessions with existing customers where they walked through the prototype with us and gave their feedback.</p><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-10.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Active Incident Form (Left) | Resolved Incident Form (Right) </small><img class="m-lg" src="/assets/images/work/id-11.png" width="100%" alt="FireHydrant Design System web interface"><small>Incident Form in drawer</small><h3>What worked<i class="ph-duotone ph-thumbs-up"></i></h3><ul> <li>Modularity + simplicity</li><li>Incident types</li></ul><h3 class="space-top-md">What didn't<i class="ph-duotone ph-thumbs-down"></i></h3><ul> <li>Drawer is confusing</li><li>Resolved incidents needs more thought + education </li></ul><h3 class="space-top-md">What needs improvement<i class="ph-duotone ph-sparkle"></i></h3><ul> <li>Incident types need more explanation to work out of the box</li><li>Admin experience around required fields</li></ul></section><section><h2>Phased Rollout</h2><p>Based on user feedback we decided to stick with the existing single page form view instead of a drawer.
